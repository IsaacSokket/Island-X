### Warnings:

TW: Disturbing Imagery, Loud Noises, Flashing lights.

These projects may contain loud noises, disturbing imagery, and may effect your PC or labtop.
I highly suggest running these with certain permissions off for that site, unless you are running a VM.
I am not responsible for any damage done.

<h4>Warnings for chrome users:</h4>

Dear ChromeOS users, please be careful running these scripts!
Running `crash.js` will shut off you computer entirely!
To fix this problem if you do, just press the power button and reload at the same time. Otherwise you may never see your chromebook again.
Thanks!
